# HackBio Internship Experience

As part of our internship at HackBio, we participated in three internships, each of which provided valuable lessons in Python coding.

## Team Members
We were a team of two:
- **Chama BENSLIMANE**
- **Mohammad HICHAM**

Both of us contributed to code formation and README writing.

## Internship Stages

### **Stage 0: Introduction to Python**
This beginner-friendly stage introduced us to fundamental Python concepts, including:
- Dictionaries
- Lists
- Other basic Python coding structures

### **Stage 1: Functional Programming**
The complexity increased as we developed four functions, each serving a specific purpose:
1. **DNA to Protein Translation** – Converting a DNA sequence into amino acids.
2. **Logistic Population Growth Simulation** – Generating and analyzing a logistic growth curve.
3. **Bacterial Growth Prediction** – Estimating the time required for a bacterial strain to reach 80% of its maximum growth.
4. **Hamming Distance Calculation** – Comparing Slack and X usernames using Hamming distance.

### **Stage 2: Domain-Specific Challenges**
In this stage, we tackled four simultaneous challenges:
- **Microbiology:** Analyzing bacterial growth curves from experimental data.
- **Botany and Plant Science:** Studying wild-type (WT) and mutant cell metabolism in response to pesticide treatment.
- **Biochemistry and Oncology:** Investigating deleterious protein mutations by merging SIFT & FoldX data and visualizing impacted amino acids.
- **Transcriptomics:** Generating a volcano plot from a dataset and identifying the top 5 upregulated and downregulated genes.

### **Stage 3: Machine Learning in Neuroscience & Psychology**
This stage introduced us to machine learning basics. We worked on a neuroscience and psychology project, where we:
- Analyzed a dataset
- Applied biostatistical and machine learning techniques
- Classified and detected signs of depression in university students

## Key Takeaways
Each of these internships deepened our understanding of Python and its application in solving real biological problems. Additionally, we honed our time management skills, which greatly benefit us in our daily work as biologists and bioinformaticians.
